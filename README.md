WordPress Theme Boilerplate
===========================

A boilerplate made by Paulund to use on a new WordPress theme.

I found myself doing the samethings when setting up a new WordPress theme so hopefully this will help speed up that process.

The purpose of the project is to be a boilerplate for your theme development.

I don't intend this to be a parent theme nor do I intend on adding the HTML for the different template files as all themes are different. This will
 just be a good place to start whenever picking up a brand new theme development project.
